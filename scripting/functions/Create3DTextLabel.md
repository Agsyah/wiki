## Returns

The ID of the newly created 3D Text Label, or INVALID_3DTEXT_ID if the 3D Text Label limit (MAX_3DTEXT_GLOBAL) was reached.

## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    Create3DTextLabel("I'm at the coordinates:\n30.0, 40.0, 50.0", 0x008080FF, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 40.0, 0, 0);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

::: tip

drawdistance seems to be a lot smaller when spectating.

:::

::: tip

Use color embedding for multiple colors in the text.

:::

::: warning

If text[] is empty, the server/clients next to the text might crash!
If the virtualworld is set as -1 the text will not appear.
